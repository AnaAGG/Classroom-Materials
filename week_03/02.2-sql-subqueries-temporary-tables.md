# Subqueries and temporary tables

A lot of times, we will need to perform some more complicated queries. Besides being a good tool to facilitate (through the magic of modularization), sometimes there are no other ways of doing some queries.

## SELECT statements return a table

Everytime we do a `SELECT` statement, we must choose a table (or tables, with join) from which we will retrieve our data. After executing the statement we are left with what? Another table.

Turns out we can actually use this table in order to continue our querying. This can be achieved in one of two ways.

## Sub-query

Since the whole select statement returns a table, we can put this statement wherever we could put a table name (after `FROM` and `JOIN` keywords).
We just have to do two little things:

- Put the `SELECT` statement between parenthesis.
- Give it a pretty name with `AS`.

### Check it out

```sql
-- This is the SELECT Statement we are executing now
SELECT SUM(`TITLE COUNT`) FROM
-- This whole SELECT statement between parenthesis is just our table
(SELECT a.au_id AS 'AUTHOR ID', au_lname AS 'LAST NAME', au_fname AS 'FIRST NAME', 
	   pub_name AS 'PUBLISHER', COUNT(t.title_id) AS 'TITLE COUNT'
FROM authors AS a
	JOIN titleauthor AS ta
		ON a.au_id = ta.au_id
	JOIN titles AS t
		ON t.title_id = ta.title_id
	JOIN publishers AS p
		ON t.pub_id = p.pub_id
GROUP BY p.pub_id, a.au_id) AS title_count
-- We named it `title_count`
;
```

In this case, we do nothing more than selecting a `SUM` from the new table. But this could contain anything a `SELECT` Statement contains: further joins, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, etc...

### Another example

```sql
-- Our SELECT statement
SELECT order_id, `date`, full_name, product, size, color, warehouse_id
FROM
-- The first table is a Subquery
	(SELECT od.order_id, `date`, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name, product_id, color_id, size_id, quantity 
	FROM gatete_web_store.orders AS od
		JOIN gatete_web_store.customers AS cust
			ON od.customer_id=cust.customer_id
		JOIN gatete_web_store.order_description AS odesc
			ON od.order_id=odesc.order_id) AS orders_web
LEFT JOIN
-- The second table is also a subquery
	(SELECT p.`name` AS product, s.`name` AS size, c.`name` AS color, quantity , p.product_id, s.size_id, c.color_id, warehouse_id
	FROM inventory AS i
		JOIN products AS p
			ON i.product_id=p.product_id
		JOIN sizes AS s
			ON i.size_id=s.size_id
		JOIN colors AS c
			ON i.color_id=c.color_id) AS stock

ON
	orders_web.product_id=stock.product_id AND
    orders_web.size_id=stock.size_id AND
    orders_web.color_id=stock.color_id;
```

All of that is just ONE query. (TIP: count the `;`)

### How do we read that?!?!

Just image it is this query (because it actually is):

```sql
-- Our SELECT statement
SELECT order_id, `date`, full_name, product, size, color, warehouse_id
FROM
-- The first table is a Subquery
    orders_web
LEFT JOIN
-- The second table is also a subquery
	stock
ON
	orders_web.product_id=stock.product_id AND
    orders_web.size_id=stock.size_id AND
    orders_web.color_id=stock.color_id;
```

A lot simpler right? Both are the same, but since `orders_web` and `stock` are not `official` tables, we just put the code that generates them in place of their names.

It turns out there is another way.

## Temporary-Tables

We can `make it official` with the tables we have recently created. But since we just need them to make some calculations or other processes, we don't want them lingering around, occupying memory and filling up our database with redundant data. So we make them into `TEMPORARY TABLE`s.

This way, we get the benefit of calling them by a name as any other table, but when we close the SQL server they are gone and will not bother us anymore.

However, in order to achieve this, we will need to execute multiple SQL commands. One for each temporary table we want to create and the final one for our final result.

Just:
- Put `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` and a name before the SELECT query that returns the temp table you want to keep.

### Let's check it out

```sql
-- This is the first command, that will create the temporary table.
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `title_count`
-- And the select query normally after that
SELECT a.au_id AS 'AUTHOR ID', au_lname AS 'LAST NAME', au_fname AS 'FIRST NAME', 
	   pub_name AS 'PUBLISHER', COUNT(t.title_id) AS 'TITLE COUNT'
FROM authors AS a
	JOIN titleauthor AS ta
		ON a.au_id = ta.au_id
	JOIN titles AS t
		ON t.title_id = ta.title_id
	JOIN publishers AS p
		ON t.pub_id = p.pub_id
GROUP BY p.pub_id, a.au_id);
-- End of the first command. See the ;?
-- This is the second command, that will select from the previously created temp table.
SELECT SUM(`TITLE COUNT`) FROM `title_count`;
```

And done! Let's check it with the second example, in which we will create 2 temporary tables.

```sql
-- Create first table
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `orders_web`
SELECT od.order_id, `date`, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name, product_id, color_id, size_id, quantity 
	FROM gatete_web_store.orders AS od
		JOIN gatete_web_store.customers AS cust
			ON od.customer_id=cust.customer_id
		JOIN gatete_web_store.order_description AS odesc
			ON od.order_id=odesc.order_id;
-- End of first query ;
-- Create second table
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `stock`
SELECT p.`name` AS product, s.`name` AS size, c.`name` AS color, quantity , p.product_id, s.size_id, c.color_id, warehouse_id
	FROM inventory AS i
		JOIN products AS p
			ON i.product_id=p.product_id
		JOIN sizes AS s
			ON i.size_id=s.size_id
		JOIN colors AS c
			ON i.color_id=c.color_id);
-- End of second query ;
-- Third and final, where we select it all
SELECT order_id, `date`, full_name, product, size, color, warehouse_id
FROM
    orders_web
LEFT JOIN
	stock
ON
	orders_web.product_id=stock.product_id AND
    orders_web.size_id=stock.size_id AND
    orders_web.color_id=stock.color_id;
```

Just as above, but this time we acctually get it working because `orders_web` and `stock` are both tables that DO exist now.
